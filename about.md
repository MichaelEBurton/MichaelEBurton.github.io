Hi, 
My name is Michael Burton, and I am statistics student at [NC State University](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/). I am currently on track to graduate in May of 2020 with a Master's of Statistics degree. Upon graduation I plan to begin work in the data science, analytics, statistics, or related field. 

If you're viewing this website close to January 24th, 2019 then it probably isn't that impressive as I am new to Jekyll. I hope you will revisit in the future and be amazed at the progress I have made.

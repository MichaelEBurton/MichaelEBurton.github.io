I"æ<p>My last trip of the summer is definitely a contender for my favorite trip of the summer because of the route and the crew. We went all the way up crooked to Friday Bay and then down through the moosecamp river to Pipestone Bay back to base through Wind lake. This route is one that I had never been on before but other interpreterâ€™s like to take and itâ€™s not hard to see why. Along the way youâ€™re able to see not one but two waterfalls, pictographs, and even an old Buick.</p>

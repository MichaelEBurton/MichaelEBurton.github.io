I"È<p>Last summer I was fortunate enough to travel to Ely Minnesota where I set out on a two week journey into the Boundary Water Canoe area Wilderness (BWCA). On this voyage I spent the first week improving the portage trails along with six others before setting off on a 125+ mile canoe trip through the pristine wilderness. These two weeks were some of the toughest weeks but most rewarding I have ever experienced as I was pushed to my physical and mental limits.</p>

<p>When I think about my time in the BWCA I think about a group of 16 ‚Äì 23 year olds who became a family. We portaged through knee deep mud, paddled long days, sang plenty of songs, and ate plenty of great food. I could talk endlessly about my experience last summer and how it changed me as an individual but that‚Äôs not why I decided to make this blog.</p>

<p>I have been given the amazing opportunity to work as an Interpreter (Canoe Guide) at Northern Tier High adventure base. I want to use my time in the Northwoods to reflect on my experiences (both good and bad) and how they shape me. I start on the 31st of May and look forward to having you along for the voyage!</p>

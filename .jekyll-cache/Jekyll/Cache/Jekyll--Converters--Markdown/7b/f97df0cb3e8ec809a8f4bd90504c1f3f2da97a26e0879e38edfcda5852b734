I"Õ<p>Last summer I was fortunate enough to travel to Ely Minnesota where I set out on a two week journey into the Boundary Water Canoe area Wilderness (BWCA). On this voyage I spent the first week improving the portage trails along with six others before setting off on a 125+ mile canoe trip through the pristine wilderness. These two weeks were some of the toughest weeks but most rewarding I have ever experienced as I was pushed to my physical and mental limits.</p>

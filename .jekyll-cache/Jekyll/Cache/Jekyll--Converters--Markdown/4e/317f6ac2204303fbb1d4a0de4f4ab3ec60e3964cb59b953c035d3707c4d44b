I"%<p>Since my last post I’ve had a ton of fun adventures in the East and the wild West.</p>

<p>My second trip was a very wet one because it rained nearly every day and I had a boat swamp three times. It was a very stressful trio especially when I had boats swamping. So we had gone all the way from Pipestone bay to Horse Lake in one day and it was pretty early so I decided to push down the Horse river. Going down horse that day was probably a big mistake because we made it to the end and there were no campsites. We eventually camped at the campsite right after wheelbarrow falls up and it was a pretty terrible campsite, but we had just made it through a huge ordeal, it was late, and moral was low so it worked fine.</p>

<p>When getting to the wheel barrow falls portage my boat and the second boat made it across no problem. When I turn around the third boat is in the rapids and it flips (they lost two paddles). Immediately I threw everything out of my boat got my scouts and we went back to help. We deswamped the boat put one pack in the other boat and I swapped with one of their guys. We tried going across two times and swamped on both but we’re close enough to the shore the second time to swim to shore. After that incident the rest of the trips was smooth sailing. It was great to be back at Horse portage and see the trail I worked on over a year ago. Soon after getting back to base I got my third crew.</p>

<p>For my third trip we went east and it was a nice relaxing trip with a layover day on Kekekabic lake. We day  paddled to the Kek cabin and Eddy Falls. Then the rest of trip was very smooth. The best part of this job is reading my evals afterwards and seeing scouts right the best part of their Northern Tier experience was “our interpreter.”</p>

<p>Time for my fourth trip, bon voyage!</p>

I"p<p>It’s been about a week and a half since I’ve arrived at Northern Tier. I had a bit of trouble getting up here after I missed my shuttle from the airport but the logistics staff helped me figure out an alternative way to get here. That first night I got to see my foreman from last year and that was great I’m glad to see them and be up in the Northwoods.</p>

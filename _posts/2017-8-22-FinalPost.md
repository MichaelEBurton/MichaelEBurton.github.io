My last trip of the summer is definitely a contender for my favorite trip of the summer because of the route and the crew. We went all the way up crooked to Friday Bay and then down through the moosecamp river to Pipestone Bay back to base through Wind lake. This route is one that I had never been on before but other interpreter’s like to take and it’s not hard to see why. Along the way you’re able to see not one but two waterfalls, pictographs, and even an old Buick.

The first day we traveled all the way from base close to horse portage for a total of sixteen miles. The day was long, storm clouds were approaching from the distance and we were struggling to find an open campsite. Eventually we found an open campsite which wasn’t the best but we couldn’t complain. It’s always tough the first few days with a new crew because you have to show them the ropes and thankfully I figured out better ways to explain concepts throughout the summer. I was able to figure out that this would be one of my slowest crews at portaging and paddling, but that doesn’t mean I enjoyed the trip any less.

The next day was a little stressful for me because we were going by a lot of rapids and waterfalls including one I swamped near before. The rest of trip I was able to relax a little bit more and got to see some neat things. When we passed table rock this group of dads and their sons were swimming there but upon seeing us quickly hopped in their canoes to get in front of us like we were going to steal a really good campsite from them. This kind of made me mad but we passed them later while they were setting up camp and never saw them again. I could talk about this trip for hours and write about it until I have reached the maximum word count, but I want to share one more thing from this trip.

It was our last morning on water and I had told all the scouts to stay in their tents until 8am because there was no reason to wake up earlier unless we wanted to get to base early (which isn’t allowed). Eventually I said “Okay you can all get out of your tents.” The scouts came out and said good morning. I remember one looked around for a few seconds before he realized that I was wearing a blue button up shirt, clip on tie, nice pants, and a nice jacket like you would wear to a formal event. The faces on all these scouts’ faces were priceless and I couldn’t have asked for a better reaction. Each trip up north is unique and this is one of the ways I tried to stand out from other interpreters.

 

I would not trade my experience this summer for anything else in the world!

title: How to get R and the command line to talk!
Description: Coding Tutorial
---

Although it is important to spend time learning the theory behind the statistical methods we use, it is equally as important to learn practical ways to implement them. Thankfully during my time at NC State, my professors always incorporate programming demonstrations of some form into the learning experience. These demonstrations usually involve simple scripts which leaves some, including myself, wanting more. I have always found the most interesting demonstrations were those that blended computer science and statistics such as when utilizing dynamic programming in SAS to create a GIF demonstrating the CLT. 

For this post I will be demonstrating how to use R and the command line (terminal) interactively; this is a topic I have not come across in my coursework, which is the reason I am exploring it here. My learning began with some experimentation, searching the internet, and eventually stumbling upon an excellent [tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/05-cmdline/index.html) offered by Software Carpentry.

(This walkthrough works best on Unix-based operating systems)

### Problem Set-up

Imagine that we are interested in the sampling distribution of the slope and intercept terms in simple linear regression but do not know the true distributional form. Thus, we will need to perform a simulation to observe the empirical distributions of these parameters. Even though we could perform this simulation entirely in R, there would be no fun in that so we will use the command line to call two R scripts: **data_generation0.r**, and **plots1.r**. We'll begin by looking at the first script.

### data_generation0.r
In this program we want to generate data randomly from a standard normal distribution, and we would like the user to specify the sample size from the command line. To pass arguments from the command line into R we simply use the commandArgs() function and save this to a list argument which we can now access. We extract the sample size, generate our data and then create a new variable y based on a linear transformation of x. Specifically, we multiply x by five and then add in some random noise. After this has been done we fit a simple linear regression model, extract the coefficients, and save them to a csv file.

It's important that we append our coefficients to the csv file otherwise everytime we call this program the file will be overwritten and just contain one observation for each parameter; this is not very useful in visualizing a distribution.

```r      
# Read in user defined sample size
args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)

sampsize <- args[1]

x <- rnorm(n = sampsize, mean = 0, sd = 1)

y <- 5 * x + rnorm(sampsize, mean = 0, sd = .25)

fit <- lm(y~x)

b0 <- fit$coefficients[1]
names(b0) <- NULL
b1 <- fit$coefficients[2]
names(b1) <- NULL

x <- cbind.data.frame(b0,b1)

write.table(x, file = "Coefficients.csv", sep = ",",
            append = TRUE,row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```           

### Plots1.r
Now, assuming we have a csv full of parameter estimates we can plot the empirical distributions of the slope and intercept. This is a simple script where we just read in our csv file, create histograms with overlain density plots, and save them as pngs to our working directory.

```r       
 x <- read.csv("Coefficients.csv", header = FALSE)
 

png(filename = "Intercept.png")
hist(x$V1, freq = FALSE, xlab = 'Beta 0', main = 'Empirical Distribution of Beta 0')
lines(density(x$V1))
dev.off()

png(filename = "Slope.png")
hist(x$V2, freq = FALSE, xlab = 'Beta 1', main = 'Empirical Distribution of Beta 1')
lines(density(x$V2))
dev.off()
```     

### Command Line Program
Now that we have our R scripts in place we can construct a program to be used in the command line. To begin, we want to make sure we do not have any old parameter estimates in our coefficients.csv file so we will remove the file entirely using the **rm** command. Next we construct a for loop that will run 100 times before moving on to the next part of our program; inside the for loop we need to run our data generation file by preceding the file name with "do" and following it with an argument indciating our desired sample size. Finally we run our plot file.

```        
rm ~/Documents/sandbox/Coefficients.csv

for i in {1..100}

do Rscript data_generation0.r 100

done

Rscript plots1.r
```     

### Results

Since we chose not to set a seed using the set.seed() function my results may vary from what you observe but overall we can see that the empirical distributions are relatively normal. 

![Intercept](/images/Intercept.png){:class="Intercept"}
![Slope](/images/Slope.png){:class="Slope"}

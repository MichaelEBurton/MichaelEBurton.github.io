Since I’ve last updated this page I went on two trip including my training trip also known as a swamper. Both trips overall were successful and I definitely learned something each time whether it be how to better prepare a crew before going on trail or different ways to set up a dining-fly on trail.

My first crew was from Raleigh NC and at first I wasn’t sure how they would be because they showed up almost four hours late, which I later found out was due to a medical emergency. They were a good crew overall and I was impressed by how they never complained while we were on trail. I definitely realized there were somethings I could improve for my future trips such as being more clear in putting on and taking canoes off of shoulders because although they did an okay job it was very muscled. I also can work on being more engaging with the scouts because they were very quiet and I wasn’t sure if they were just like that. Lastly I’m going to be more thorough in shakedown because it seemed liked too much stuff was packed.

The route that we took was from moose through Birch, up Knife, through the scenic lakes, then stayed on long island for a night. Saganaga is a very beautiful lake and if you ever get a chance to visit it I highly recommend it! After that we went down through Ogish to South Arm Knife, then to Ensign, and back to base. We saw tons of loons of course and they’re always great, but I also saw my first bear on trail which was awesome.

My crew gave me one of their troop neckerchiefs and they all signed it and invited me to some of their troop functions when I get back to Raleigh in the fall. My next crew arrives the 28th and then it’ll be 8 days so I’m looking forward to getting back on trail and helping change lives!
